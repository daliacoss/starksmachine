=============

Stark's Machine is a browser-based musical instrument. it consists of an additive synthesizer (Stark) and a set of instrument controllers.

Currently, the only way to play Stark is through fretboard.html, which maps cursor x-position to pitch and plays a note when the mouse is clicked. Please note that this project is pre-alpha and fretboard.html can be highly resource-intensive.
